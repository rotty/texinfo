This is an R6RS port of the Texinfo parser and serializer included in
GNU Guile.  It is in the process of being transformed to be part of
the Wak code collection.  Blocking issues include:

- Eliminating the dependency on spells

- Syncing up with the original (upstream) Guile version; this includes
  both ensuring we have all relevant changes having been made to
  upstream, and likewise upstreaming all relevant changes made on this
  codebase.
